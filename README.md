# MathQuest

Collection of functions to perform (hopefully) fast mathematical tasks for Clojure.  
Why reinventing the wheel? Some people are just love to waste their time on weekend clojuring.  

## Roadmap

1. Discrete mathematics (lcm, gcd, primes, totient, modular arithmetics, etc).  
2. Linear algebra & vector operations (mostly already done in core.matrix, just a refresher for the authors).
3. Combinatorics (combinations, permutations, discrete probability, etc).
4. Optimisation (linear, graph, etc).
5. Numerical calculus.
